                    Navagio Shipwreck Beach in Zakynthos: One of the finest gems of the Ionian Sea, <br>
                    Navagio or Shipwreck Beach is by far the most popular destination in Zakynthos <br>
                    since it is a world-famous natural sight! Known for its iconic bright turquoise <br>
                    waters and the gigantic cliffs that surround this magnificent bay, the seashore <br>
                    (also called Smugglers Cove) is so renowned it can be spotted in plenty of <br> 
                    postcards and souvenirs in various spots of Greece. The stunning combination of <br>
                    clear waters and white sand makes it stand out amongst all other shores of the <br>
                    island.

                    The waters of the Pacific Northwest may be too cold for swimming most days, but that <br>
                    doesn't make them any less beautiful. Just two hours from Portland, Oregon you'll find <br>
                    undeniable beauty on Cannon Beach. The town here is charming, but it is the towering <br>
                    235-foot high Haystack Rock and its surrounding needle-shaped rocks that give this beach <br>
                    its own skyline. One of the most photographed places in Oregon, it can get crowded here,<br>
                    but there's a long stretch of scenery to enjoy in this area. After you visit Cannon Beach, <br>
                    you can set up your picnic at Hug Point or Ecola State Park.

                    In terms of must-visit sites in Australia, Whitehaven Beach is up there with Sydney Opera <br>
                    House and Noosa National Park. From above, the destination's ever-shifting swirl of salt-white <br>
                    sand and brilliant blue water resemble a precious marbled jewel. Made of extremely fine, <br>
                    silica-rich quartz, the squeaky-soft sand is some of the smoothest and whitest in the world. <br>
                    To reach this paradise, you can fly into the Hamilton Island Airport and take a ferry to the <br>
                    Whitsunday Islands.

                    mouthwash. Bora Bora is a cliched vision of the heavenly beach. Even if you never get <br>
                    to go, this is one for the mental image bank at least - use it when meditating. Matira <br>
                    beach on the island, and somewhere you could mingle with locals. The Bora Bora Hotel <br>
                    has to win as the only public(bungalows from £1,852 a week half-board including transfers, <br>
                    Eden Beach boraborahotel.com), built on its own coral isle, has its own private beach <br>
                    that may be a grain prettier, for its view of beautiful rock peak Otemanu.

                    Located on a remote island that's about as far away from the US as it's possible to <br>
                    get, massive granite boulders make Anse Source d'Argent feel like a prehistoric piece <br>
                    of paradise, carving out cozy nooks where those seeking peace and quiet can hide away <br>
                    from any crowds. Its blissfully shallow waters are sublime for those who prefer to dip <br>
                    and float rather than swim. Explorers, on the other hand, will get a kick out of meeting <br>
                    the colorful marine denizens who live in the patches of coral reef that pepper the area.

                    Elafonissi Beach in Crete takes extraordinary to a whole new level, tantalizing <br>
                    beach-goers and social media addicts with its powdery soft pink sands, a result of <br>
                    the pink shells who have made the ultimate sacrifice to give us something to Instagram <br>
                    about. The sandbar and shallow waters are a perfect venue for relaxing and for <br>
                    family-friendly dips, and the local loggerhead sea turtles are a sight to see <br>
                    (from afar, naturally).

                    Durdle Door is probably the most famous stone arch anywhere in the world. Looking <br>
                    west over the beach, isolated stacks out at sea show where an older coastline once <br>
                    lay. This part of the coast is formed from merged bays and shows how Lulworth Cove <br>
                    and Stair Hole may look in several thousand years time. Durdle Door is a must-see for<br>
                    any trip to this region. From camping to rock-pooling, walking to coasteering, <br>
                    photography to nature walks, or to just enjoy the stunning views. There's plenty <br>
                    to do and see here.

                    The beach is also a popular spot for windsurfing and kitesurfing, thanks to consistent <br>
                    and steady winds. Enjoy the beautiful colors of the sky as the sun rises and sets over <br>
                    the Pacific Ocean and admire the beautiful houses and gardens of the surrounding <br>
                    residential area of Kailu. Come prepared as there are no amenities at this beach.

                    Copacabana is without a doubt the most famous beach in the world. The boulevard <br>
                    was designed by Brazilian architect Roberto Burle Marx, Fred and Ginger danced <br>
                    in the Copacabana Palace Hotel, and celebrities such as Marlene Dietrich and Lady <br>
                    Diana have stayed here. The beach along the crescent-shaped bay is dozens of metres <br>
                    wide and is beautifully situated between rock formations and swaying palm trees. <br>
                    It is always busy here from daybreak until way past sundown.
